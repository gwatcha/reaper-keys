# Reaper keys

Reaper keys is an extension for the [REAPER DAW](https://www.reaper.fm/) that provides a
new action mapping system based on key sequences instead of key chords. The system is
similar to [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29), a modal text
editor, and by default comes with vim-like bindings.

installation video.

## Pros

- Save a couple minutes per hour
- Develop arthritis at 60 instead of 40
- Reduce mouse usage
- Increase maximum bandwidth between your brain and your project
- A structure for Reaper's giant bag of actions

## Installation

- Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwatcha/reaper-keys/master/index.xml` to Reapack.
- Optionally, install [SWS](https://sws-extension.org/) (by hand or from ReaTeam
  Extensions). Although this extension _may_ work without SWS, the experience will be
  worse.

## Features
### Bind key sequences

With Reaper keys you may bind key sequences to actions rather then singular key presses.
This allows one to hierarchically organize many keybindings.
A completion/feedback window is provided to assist with command completion.

### Compose actions

Reaper keys lets one compose actions of different types to create new commands. For
example, in normal mode, any action with `timeline motion` type can follow any one with
`timeline operator` type. So if one enters `tL`, it would compose into `(t ->
"PlayAndLoop", L -> "NextMeasure")`, and play and loop the next measure.

Other examples of `timeline operator` bindings are `s` -> "SelectItemsAndSplit" , or `z`
-> "ZoomTimeSelection", so you could also enter `sL` or `zL`.

This grows the number of available actions exponentially but still preserves your brain,
as you only need to know the `timeline_motions`, `timeline_operators`, and the fact that
you can compose them.

### Multi-modal

Changing modes changes the way keys compose. By default, it is in `normal` mode, but you
could for example go into `visual timeline` mode by pressing `v`.

In this mode, `timeline motions` extend the current time selection, and `timeline actions`
operate immediately and return one to `normal` mode. Useful if you want visual feedback
before executing a timeline action, or just want to extend the time selection using motion
commands.

### Macros

Macros are a way to save a sequence of commands, and play them back later.

To record a macro, enter `q` and an arbitrary character to specify the `register` that the
macro will save into. Then, perform a series of actions, and finish recording by pressing
`q`.

You may play it back by entering `@` and the character you specified earlier. Optionally,
prefix it with a number to indicate the number of repetitions.

## Help

Enter `<CM-x> (Ctrl + Alt + x)` to show a list of available bindings you can search and
filter.

If you're stuck in a state you don't know how to get out of, you can press `<ESC>` to
reset back to normal.

Also, if your key press is not being detected, try unfocusing the feedback window.

## Tweaking

```
internal/definitions/actions.lua -> add actions
internal/definitions/bindings.lua -> add or customise key bindings
internal/definitions/config.lua -> change GUI settings
```

## Reporting performance issues

1. Download "Lua profiler" from ReaTeam Scripts and "ReaImGui" from ReaTeam Extensions via
ReaPack.
2. Change "profile" to "true" in internal/definitions/config.lua
3. In Reaper, click Actions > Running script > rk.lua > Terminate instances. There may be
no "Running script", then just skip this step.
4. Press any key. A profiler window will open.
5. Click "Acquisition > Stop" in the profiler window after you're done
6. Click "Copy to clipboard". Paste in a GitHub issue.
7. When you're done, change "profile" back to false and repeat (3)
